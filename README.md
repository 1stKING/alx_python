Random Number Checker
This Python script generates a random signed number and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

How to Use
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the script by executing the command: python script_name.py (replace script_name.py with the actual name of your script).
Output
The script will output the generated number followed by:

If the number is greater than 0: "is positive"
If the number is 0: "is zero"
If the number is less than 0: "is negative"
Important Note
The number variable is assigned a different value each time you run the program.
